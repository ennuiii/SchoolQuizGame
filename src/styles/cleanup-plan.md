# CSS Cleanup and Consolidation Plan

## Changes Made

1. **Unified CSS Structure**
   - Created `unified-theme.css` that consolidates:
     - Base theme variables and colors
     - Global component styling
     - Component-specific styling
     - All utility classes
   - Created `unified-transitions.css` that focuses solely on:
     - Performance-optimized theme transition handling
     - GPU acceleration techniques
     - Background texture management during transitions

2. **DRY Implementation**
   - Eliminated duplicate selectors and rules across multiple files
   - Consolidated component-specific styles with shared CSS variables
   - Removed redundant style definitions
   - Organized CSS into logical sections with clear comments

3. **Performance Improvements**
   - Reduced CSS file count from 5+ to just 2 main CSS files
   - Optimized selectors and reduced specificity
   - Added targeted GPU acceleration hints
   - Better separation of concerns: themes vs transitions

## Files to Delete

The following files are now obsolete and can be deleted:
- `theme.css`
- `dark-theme-enhancements.css`
- `theme-transitions.css`
- `component-styles.css`
- All individual component CSS files:
  - `AnswerList.css`
  - `GameControls.css`
  - `QuestionDisplay.css`
  - `QuestionSelector.css`
  - `RoomSettings.css`
  - `QuestionDisplayCard.css`

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**
   - All components now share the same consistent styling in both light and dark modes
   - Common elements like buttons, cards, and inputs have unified appearance
   - No more divergent styling between different components

2. **Maintainability**
   - Single source of truth for all styling
   - Easier to make global style changes
   - Clear organization with comments for future development

3. **Performance**
   - Fewer CSS files means fewer HTTP requests
   - Better optimization for theme transitions
   - More efficient browser rendering and less CSS parsing

4. **Developer Experience**
   - No need to search through multiple files to understand styling
   - Clear naming conventions and organization
   - Easy to find and modify specific styles

## Next Steps

1. All components should no longer import their individual CSS files
2. Delete obsolete CSS files to clean up the codebase
3. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all styles are applied correctly
4. Review any component-specific styles that might need refinement
