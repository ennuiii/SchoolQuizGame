# CSS Optimization & Dark Mode Cleanup Instructions

## Changes Made

1. **CSS Organization**:
   - Created `component-styles.css` that consolidates all component-specific styles using DRY principles
   - Completely refactored `dark-theme-enhancements.css` to be much lighter and more focused
   - Updated `theme.css` to use CSS variables consistently through the app
   - Optimized `theme-transitions.css` for better performance

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Reduced CSS selectors and specificity - fewer, more efficient selectors
   - Added GPU acceleration hints with proper containment
   - Improved transitions with optimization techniques like:
     - Temporarily disabling background images during transitions
     - Using will-change and GPU hints
     - Applying transform: translateZ(0) for GPU acceleration
   - Implemented requestAnimationFrame for smoother theme transitions

3. **ThemeContext Enhancements**:
   - Added a new helper function `applyThemeClass` to optimize theme transitions for specific components
   - Implemented better state management for transitions
   - Added component-specific optimizations for GameMaster page

## Files to Remove (Optional)

These files are now redundant as their styles have been consolidated:

```
src/components/shared/QuestionDisplayCard.css
src/components/game-master/RoomSettings.css
src/components/game-master/QuestionSelector.css
src/components/game-master/QuestionDisplay.css
src/components/game-master/GameControls.css
src/components/game-master/AnswerList.css
```

## Component Updates Required

These components need to have their CSS imports removed:

1. `src/components/shared/QuestionDisplayCard.tsx` - Remove `import './QuestionDisplayCard.css';`
2. `src/components/game-master/RoomSettings.tsx` - Remove `import './RoomSettings.css';`
3. `src/components/game-master/QuestionSelector.tsx` - Remove `import './QuestionSelector.css';`
4. `src/components/game-master/QuestionDisplay.tsx` - Remove `import './QuestionDisplay.css';`
5. `src/components/game-master/GameControls.tsx` - Remove `import './GameControls.css';`
6. `src/components/game-master/AnswerList.tsx` - Remove `import './AnswerList.css';`

## Testing Instructions

1. After implementing these changes, make sure to clear your browser cache
2. Test theme switching throughout the app, especially on GameMaster page
3. Verify that all component styles are correctly applied in both themes
4. Measure performance improvement when switching themes

## Benefits of This Optimization

1. **Better Performance**: Theme transitions are now much faster with GPU acceleration
2. **DRY Code**: Eliminated duplication across CSS files
3. **Easier Maintenance**: All component styles in one place
4. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of theme variables vs component styles
5. **Reduced CSS Size**: Smaller CSS bundle with fewer redundant rules

This refactoring should significantly improve the performance of theme switching in your app while maintaining all the visual styling across components.
