CHANGES MADE TO SCHOOL QUIZ GAME
=============================

Date: May 6, 2025
File modified: src/pages/Player.tsx

ISSUE FIXED:
- Fixed a bug where text answers were being overwritten by "Drawing submitted (time's up)" message when time runs out
- Fixed a similar issue in the manual submission function

CHANGES MADE:
1. Modified the 'time_up' event handler to prioritize text answers over drawings
2. Added logic to include "(with drawing)" note when both text answer and drawing exist
3. Applied the same logic to the manual submitAnswer function for consistency

HOW TO COMMIT:
1. Install Git if not already installed: https://git-scm.com/download/win
